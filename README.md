# Developer Test Project

This project was written in June 2022 for as part of an application for a junior developer role. 

React was used to create components for each design section, and Tailwind CSS was installed for the styling to allow me to get to grips with it.

## Installation

Clone the project to your pc using:

<code>git clone https://github.com/staceycoils/se-devtest-2022.git</code>

cd into the project and run <code>npm i</code> to install the dependencies.

### Development Build

To view a development build, run <code>npm start</code>. When ready, use the provided port number to access the site.

### Production build

To access the final version of the design, run <code>npm run build</code>. When this has finished, follow the commands given by the terminal to host the project locally. Once complete, this will then give you the local address for the project.

The build can be ejected by running <code>npm run eject</code>.
