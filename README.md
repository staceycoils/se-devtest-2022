# Developer Test Project

This project was written in June 2022 for as part of an application for a junior developer role. 

React was used to create components for each design section, and Tailwind CSS was installed for the styling to allow me to get to grips with it.

## Installation

Clone the project to your pc using:

<code>git clone https://github.com/staceycoils/se-devtest-2022.git</code>

cd into the project and run <code>npm i</code> to install the dependencies.

### Development Build

To view a development build, run <code>npm start</code>. When ready, use the provided port number to access the site.

### Production build

To access the final version of the design, run <code>npm run build</code>. When this has finished, you will be provided with the <code>serve -s build</code> command to host the project locally. When this completes, you will be given the port number the project is being hosted on.
